## Setup

Clone or download the repo

- run `yarn install` or `npm install` to install the dependencies
- run `yarn seed` or `node db/seeds` to seed the database
- run `node index.js` (or simply `nodemon` if you have nodemon installed) to start the app

You will need [node](https://nodejs.org/) and [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) set up on your local environment.

If you do not have them, I would advise installing them with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (Mac only).
